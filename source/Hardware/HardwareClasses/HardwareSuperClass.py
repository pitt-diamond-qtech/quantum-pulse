"""
HardwareSuperClass is a class meant to outline the behavior that will be common to all hardware instruments in DuttLab.

HardwareDevice may be directly inherited in the instrument's class, or HardwareSuperClass may be inherited by an
instrument-type subclass from which the instrument will then be derived.
[ex. WaveformGenerator will inherit from HardwareSuperClass, and AWG520 will inherit from WaveformGenerator]

        (the wave form generators will implement the startUp method differently than the adwin may.) Otherwise,
